# BEVI Analysis

This project analyzes survey data related to international and intercultural learning experiences, with a focus on how these experiences and interests vary across different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic and by gender.

## Main Script: `bevi_analysis.py`

- **Data Source:**
  - The script loads data from an Excel file (update the path in the script as needed)
  - It expects columns such as `FinishOnUtc`, `Age`, `TimeInAnotherCountry`, `InterestInInternationalOrInterculturalLearning`, and `Gender`.

- **Processing:**
  - Converts survey completion dates to datetime and categorizes them into three periods: Pre-COVID, COVID, and Post-COVID.
  - Computes summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max) for age, time spent abroad, and interest in international/intercultural learning.
  - Groups and summarizes data by COVID period and gender.
  - Calculates and describes correlations between variables (age, time abroad, interest) for each period and gender.

- **Visualization:**
  - Generates histograms showing the distribution of interest, time abroad, and age by COVID period.
  - Creates scatterplots with regression lines for key variable pairs, faceted by COVID period and colored by gender.
  - Saves or displays plots (some are saved as PNG files in this directory).

## Output Files

- The PNG files in this directory are visualizations generated by the analysis script, including:
  - Distributions of interest in international/intercultural learning, time spent abroad, and age by COVID period.
  - Scatterplots showing relationships between age, time abroad, and interest, broken down by COVID period and gender.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scipy
- openpyxl (for reading Excel files)

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scipy openpyxl
```

## Usage

1. Place your survey data Excel file in an accessible location and update the `file_path` variable in `bevi_analysis.py`.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python bevi_analysis.py
   ```
3. Review the console output for summary statistics and correlation descriptions.
4. View the generated PNG files for visualizations.

## Notes
- The script assumes specific column names in the Excel file. Adjust as needed for your dataset.
- Some plots are shown interactively; others may be saved as files. Uncomment `plt.show()` lines to display plots interactively.
